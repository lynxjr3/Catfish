## How to Contribute and Set Up the Development Environment

If you want to contribute, modify the project, or make it your own, I recommend using [**NetBeans 26**](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/index.html) as the IDE.
You will need to download [**JCEF** (Java Chromium Embedded Framework)](https://github.com/jcefmaven/jcefbuild/releases/tag/1.0.66)
After downloading, extract the JCEF files into a folder you create (make sure to extract **only the `bin` folder**). Then, add the following VM option to your project configuration:

`-Djava.library.path=..\..\bin\lib\win64` 

Finally, open the project in NetBeans, and youâ€™re ready to start developing!
